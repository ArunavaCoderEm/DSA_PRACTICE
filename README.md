# DSA_3RD_SEM_PRACTICE
These are all my Data Structure And Algorithm Codes From My 3RD Semester. Will Be Updating Always In A While.

# Added - 
1. Singly Linked List , Doubly Linked List, Singly Circular Linked List, Doubly Circular Linked List - LinkedListGodard.c
2. Stack Using Array (Static And Dynamic) And Linked List (Singly) - stackgodard.c
3. Queue Using Array (Static And Dynamic) And Linked List (Singly) - queueGodard.c
4. Linear Search And Binary Search - searchingGodard.c
5. Bubble Sort And Merge Sort - sortingGodard.c
6. Binary Tree And Binary Search Tree - treesGodard.c
7. AVL tree insertion , rotation , creation , balance factor and height - avltreeGodard.c

 Rest are added as their own file name.

Now the AVL conversion has several answer for same question and the above mentioned is one of them , to get the output that's showing in terminal you can try different ways considering the correct methods.
BUT IN MY CASE THE PRE-ORDER (ROOT - LEFT - RIGHT) TRAVERSAL IS -- 14 -> 11 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 16


# Update ?
Will Be Updating Them Twice A Week.

# Programming Language Used - 
C - Language
